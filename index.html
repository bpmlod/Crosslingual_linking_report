  This document aims to give advice on different representation mechanisms for linking data across different languages on the Semantic Web. We first outline the scope of the guidelines, clarifying the intended audience and the types of language resource to which they apply. Then, inspired by an adapted version of the Vauquois Triangle, we review the different possible levels of representation at which cross-lingual linking can be implemented.  We analyse each possibility (e.g., linking at the conceptual level, at the lexical level, etc.) and exemplify them with real cases. Then, we give concrete advice on how to model cross-lingual links in the light of an adapted Vauquois Triangle. Then, we give concrete advice on how to model cross-lingual links in the light of this adapted Vauquois Triangle. Finally, we review, from a practical point of view, the different representation mechanisms available to describe links across linguistic data in different languages. Note that whilst recognising the relevance of techniques for automated cross-lingual link discovery, these guidelines focus on general representation issues of cross-lingual data.

    <h2>Scope of Guidelines</h2>
    These guidelines are intended for producers of resources which involve several languages and links among them. Inevitably, such resources involve the modelling and creation of cross-lingual (CL) links. Such links enable CL access to lexical and semantic representation. They also facilitate dynamic computation (via federated queries) of lexical equivalences between languages.

There are diverse ways in which such links can be implemented, depending on which kinds of entities are linked and the relations available to link them together. This diversity gives rise to the problem of choosing an implementation method. 

Our main objective is to provide a perspective from which to resolve this problem based on an adapted version of the Vauquois Triangle  (Vauquois 1968). This offers a point of departure for comparing different CL linking methods within the linguistic linked (open) data (LLD) framework and thus a basis for practical advice on how to proceed with linking data associated with different languages. 
 
   <section>
      <h3>Types of resources</h3>
		<p> We are concerned here with language resources that contain descriptions of lexical items, such as dictionaries, thesauri, ontologies, terminologies, taxonomies, and encyclopaedic resources. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, and it excludes resources that are highly composite, such as corpora, which are essentially collections and may incorporate CL links internally. Such resources may be within the scope of future versions of these guidelines.

		</p>
  
  <!--      <p>The type of language resources covered in this document is <i>bilingual electronic dictionaries</i>. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilingual_dictionary">bilingual dictionary</a> is a specialized dictionary used to translate words or phrases from one language to another. They can be unidirectional or bidirectional, allowing translation, in the latter case, to and from both languages. In addition to the translation, a bilingual dictionary usually indicates the part of speech, gender, verb type, declination model and other grammatical properties to help a non-native speaker use the word. 
	  </p><p>
	  We are interested in bilingual dictionaries that have their data in a machine-processable format, no matter whether it is stored locally or is accessible on the Web (e.g., for download). We assume that the data is represented in a structured or semi-structured way (e.g., relational database, xml, csv, etc.).
	  </p><p>
	  We will illustrate our discussion with real examples from the conversion of the Apertium dictionaries into RDF [<cite><a href="#bib-ap_rdf">AP_RDF</a></cite>]. Apertium [<cite><a href="#bib-ap_paper">AP_PAPER</a></cite>] is a free/open-source machine translation platform originally designed to translate between closely related languages, although it has recently been expanded to treat more divergent language pairs. There exist Lexical Markup Framework [<cite><a href="#bib-lmf">LMF</a></cite>] versions of their linguistic data which can be found <a href="http://metashare.upf.edu/repository/search/?q=apertium+lmf">here</a></cite> and have been used as starting point for the RDF version.

      <h2>Levels of cross-lingual linking</h2>
      <p> CL links associate items in one language with items expressed in another language. Such links are usually directional with the two languages being referred to as <em>source</em> and <em>target</em>. They are used to create resources for a variety of applications such as CL information retrieval, word translation, CL ontology mapping, and machine translation. </p>
      <p> Previous works have recognised that both monolingual and CL linking can occur at different levels. For instance, writing from a Semantic Web perspective, Gracia et al. (2012)  [ADD CITE] consider that links can be established at three different levels: <em>conceptual level</em>, where links are established between classes or properties as modelled in an ontology or vocabulary; <em>instance level</em>, where links are established between specific individuals/entities belonging to certain ontology classes; and <em>linguistic level</em>, where links are established between the linguistic manifestation of the ontology entities (e.g., their associated lexical entries). </p>
       <p> In order to clarify the usage of levels in CL linking, we make use of the <em>Adapted Vauquois Triangle</em>, shown in Figure 1, to present the various ways in which CL links can be implemented. This is an adaptation of the Vauquois Triangle first proposed by Bernard Vauquois in 1968 to illustrate a range of possible architectures for rule-driven transfer-based MT systems current during the 1970s and 80s. Two important aspects of the original triangle are retained. First, the horizontal dimension reflects cross-linguality, the left and right sides referring to <em>source</em> and <em>target</em> languages respectively. Second, the vertical dimension represents different levels of semantic abstraction. The original triangle pre-specifies the intermediate levels. However, the adapted version differs in the number and choice of levels. At the bottom is the surface linguistic form, e.g., a word, and at the top is an ontological referent, i.e., something conceptual and purely semantic, constituting an entity or element within an ontology. In between these extremes, moving upward, are a series of levels that proceed from the surface towards the meaning.  </p>
	  
	The adapted Vauquois triangle, for the cross-lingual linking case, is illustrated in the following figure.
	   <br>
      <figure id="fig1">
			<center>
			<img style="width: 90%" src="./img/Adapted Vauquois.png" alt="Adapted Vauquois triangle">
			<figcaption><span class="fig-title">Adapted Vauquois triangle</span></figcaption>
			</center>
      </figure>

<p> The ontological referent serves as a natural vertex that joins the two edges, in each respective language, and allows traversing the triangle from one language to the other, reaching any possible lexical-semantic level from source to target and vice-versa. In reality, however, the common vertex is often missing, thus obliging to linking at other levels. </p>

<p> The choice of levels is largely inspired by Ontolex [ADD CITE], a W3C lexicon model for ontologies which includes some of the definitions reproduced below: </p>

<p> We understand the <b>ontological referent</b> as a conceptual element, a unit of thought, that can be represented in terms of an ontology entity (class, property, or individual). We assume that it is language neutral and can be lexicalised differently in different languages and can be adapted (or not) to a particular cultural and/or linguistic view. Its adaptation to such different languages or cultural views results in the <b>concept</b> that we refer to in the figure, which belongs to the edge of a particular language.  </p>

<p> In practice, the concept (as in the case of the ontological referent) can be defined through an ontology entity (e.g, class, property, or individual in OWL or RDFS; but also through a skos:Concept or ontolex:LexicalConcept).  </p>

<p> As an illustrative example of a ontological referent we show here a concept defined as a Interlingual Lexical Concept (CILI) in Global Wordnet. Notice that although a description is given in English (other languages can be added), the intention is to have a common referent for such a concept no matter the particular language. </p>

 <pre><code>
&lt;i36300&gt; a &lt;Concept&gt; ;
               skos:definition "a flight maneuver; aircraft tips laterally about its longitudinal 
                                axis (especially in turning)"@en ;
               dc:source pwn30:00169305-n .
 </code></pre>
	
Such a common ontological referent can be associated with specific monolingual concepts. In our example, with Wordnet synsets in English and German:

 <pre><code>		
ili:i36300 	owl:sameAs 	pwn31:100170126-n . # bank
ili:i36300	owl:sameAs	odwn13:00169305-n . # rol, wenden, wending, rollen
 </pre></code>		

A <b>lexical sense</b> represents the lexical meaning of a lexical entry when interpreted as referring to the corresponding ontology element. A lexical sense thus represents a reification of a pair of a uniquely determined lexical entry and a uniquely determined ontology entity it refers to. A link between a lexical entry and an ontology entity via a lexical sense object implies that the lexical entry can be used to refer to the ontology entity in question. 

A <b>lexical entry</b> represents a unit of analysis of the lexicon that consists of a set of forms that are grammatically related and a set of base meanings that are associated with all of these forms. Thus, a lexical entry is a word, multiword expression or affix with a single part-of-speech, morphological pattern, etymology and set of senses..

Following our running example, different lexical senses can be defined to associate different WordNet concepts with the lexical entry for “bank”:

<pre><code>	
:bank_n1 a ontolex:LexicalEntry;
    ontolex:sense :bank_sense1;
    ontolex:sense :bank_sense2.
	
:bank_sense1 a ontolex:LexicalSense;
    ontolex:reference pwn31:100170126-n. #bank as a “flight maneuver”
	
:bank_sense2 a ontolex:LexicalSense;
    ontolex:reference pwn31:108437235-n.   #bank as a “depository financial institution”
</code></pre>	

	
The <b>lexical form</b> property relates a lexical entry to one grammatical form variant of the lexical entry. ​​It represents one grammatical realisation of a lexical entry. Different forms are used to express different morphological realisations of the entry (e.g. plural vs singular or canonical vs non-canonical). 
Finally, a form can have an associated <em>written representation</em>, but also others such as the <em>phonetic representation</em>. We refer to such a “bottom” representation level as <b>surface form</b> in this document, despite the term not being used as such in the Ontolex specification. 

For example, the plural form of the English noun bank may be described by the following lexical form, with their corresponding surface forms (written and phonetic representations, in the example):

<pre><code>	
:bank_n1 ontolex:lexicalForm :bank-n1-pl-form.

:bank_n1_pl_form a ontolex:LexicalForm ;
                 ontolex:writtenRep “banks”@en; 
                 ontolex:phoneticRep “/bæŋks/”@en-fonipa; 
                 lexinfo:number lexinfo:plural . 
</code></pre>

	
Notice that a common surface form may correspond to several lexical forms, e.g., the surface form “banks”@en may correspond to several lexical forms, among which the plural form of the noun bank or the third person singular form of the verb bank. The same goes for the surface form “/bæŋks/”@en-fonipa.
